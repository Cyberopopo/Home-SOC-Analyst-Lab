**Project:** Threat hunting workflows & saved searches in Wazuh / Splunk / Elastic  
**Objective:** Create hypothesis-driven hunts, implement queries, document findings, and tune detections.

## Threat hunting methodology (high level)
1. **Hypothesis** — e.g., "Unusual PowerShell child-processes after hours indicate possible lateral movement"
2. **Data sources** — Sysmon, Windows Security, Firewall logs, Proxy logs
3. **Searches** — YARA, KQL, SPL, or Wazuh query language

5. **Tune** — Convert true positives into detection rules
