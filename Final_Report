# 05_Final_Report
**Deliverable:** Complete SOC Investigation & Lab Summary report for portfolio / employers

---

## Purpose
This folder contains the final polished report summarizing the entire home-lab SOC project: Wazuh setup, attack simulations, endpoint detections, threat hunting, and lessons learned. It is written in a professional, executive-friendly format suitable for attaching to job applications.

---

## Final report structure (suggested)
- **Title Page**
  - Project name, your name, date, short description
- **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
  - High-level findings and outcomes
- **Environment & Architecture**
  - Diagram (include `/screenshots/soc_lab_architecture.png`)
  - VM specs and IP mapping
- **Deployment Steps**
  - Key commands and notes for Wazuh deploy
- **Incident Case Studies**
  - 2–3 incidents (from `02_Attack_Simulations`) with timelines, logs, screenshots, MITRE mapping
- **Threat Hunting Summary**
  - Example hunts and outcomes
- **Recommendations & Remediation**
  - Short-term and long-term remediation steps
- **Appendix**
  - Full log snippets (redacted), config files, credentials used in lab (note they are test creds)

---

## Example Executive Summary
> This portfolio documents a home-lab SOC built with Wazuh, a Windows 10 endpoint instrumented with Sysmon and Wazuh Agent, and a Kali Linux attacker VM. Multiple simulated threat scenarios (brute force, PowerShell abuse, port scans) were executed and successfully detected. Alerts were triaged, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and documented with recommended remediation steps. This demonstrates end-to-end SOC analyst skills: deployment, detection, investigation, and reporting.

---

## Required files (deliverable)
- `SOC_Final_Report.pdf` — polished PDF (exported from markdown)
- `SOC_Final_Report.md` — source markdown
- `screenshots/`:
  - `soc_lab_architecture.png`
  - `final_incident_timeline.png`
  - `final_executive_dashboard.png`
- `appendix/` — raw logs and configs

---

## Report checklist before publishing
- [ ] All screenshots present and properly named
- [ ] Sensitive data redacted
- [ ] MITRE IDs included for all incidents
- [ ] Short remediation items for each incident
- [ ] PDF generated and linked in repo root

---

## Example incident summary (short)
**Incident 1 — RDP Brute Force (2025-10-02)**  
- **Detection:** Multiple failed RDP login attempts followed by success (Wazuh rule 5716)  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.56.30 (Kali)  
- **Timeline:** 10:01 — 10:07 UTC (25 failed attempts, 1 success)  
- **MITRE Technique:** T1110 (Brute Force)  
- **Remediation:** Block source IP, enforce lockout policy, rotate affected account credentials, enable MFA.
